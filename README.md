# App and Data Restoration Program
Do you wish to immediately restore your PC, after you reset or get a new PC?
Well, now you can!
This program aims to restore all of your data, including apps and personal files.
# How the Program Works
The program will first prompt you to input your recover directory. The directory sample is found within the source code.
When you run the program again, it will use the directory to restore you apps and data. During that, you may also choose which app and data to restore.
